They cannot contain special characters such as @ or #.\n","\n","- Variable names are case-sensitive. For example, my_variable and My_Variable are two different variable names.\n","\n","- Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful.

Use names that are long enough to be descriptive, but not so long that they become difficult to read or type.\n","\n","- Avoid using reserved words as variable names.

Here are some guidelines for good naming conventions in Python:\n","\n","- Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes. This makes it easier to understand what the code does and how it works.\n","\n","- Use lowercase letters for variable and function names, and use underscores to separate words. For example, my_variable is a good variable name, while myVariable or myvariable are less readable.\n","\n","- Use uppercase letters for class names, and use CamelCase notation to separate words. For example, MyClass is a good class name, while myclass or my_class are less readable.\n","\n","- Use single letter variable names only for temporary variables, such as loop counters. For other variables, use descriptive names that reflect their purpose.\n","\n","- Avoid using names that are too short or too long. Names that are too short, such as x or y, can be unclear and make the code harder to read.
