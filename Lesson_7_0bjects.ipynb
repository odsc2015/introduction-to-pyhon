An object is a data structure that has attributes (also called properties) and methods (functions that operate on those properties). OOP is important because it provides a way to organize code and data into reusable, modular pieces that can be used across different parts of a program or in different programs altogether.\n","\n","\n","here are the components of an object in object-oriented programming:\n","\n","- Attributes/Properties: These are variables that store the state of an object, such as its size, color, or name.\n","- Methods/Functions: These are functions that operate on an object's state or behavior, such as changing its size, moving it, or displaying it on screen.\n","- Constructor: This is a special method that is called when an object is created, and is used to initialize its state and behavior.\n","- Destructor: This is a special method that is called when an object is destroyed, and is used to clean up any resources that the object is using.\n","- Class: This is the blueprint or template for creating objects, which defines the attributes, methods, constructor, and destructor that each object of that class will have. \n","- Object: This is an instance of a class, created from the blueprint defined by the class, which has its own state and behavior.\n","\n","## Python Classes\n","\n","In OOP, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class. A class defines a set of properties and behaviors that are common to all objects created from that class. Once a class is defined, objects can be created from it, and each object is a separate instance with its own unique set of values for the properties defined in the class. The class provides a structure for the object, while the object is the specific instance created from that structure.\n","\n","In Python, a class is defined using the class keyword, followed by the name of the class, and a colon. The class body is then indented, similar to control structures in Python.\n","\n","The syntax for a Python class is as

It cannot access the attributes and methods of a class unless they are passed as arguments.\n","\n","The key difference between class methods and regular functions is that class methods are bound to the class and have access to its attributes and methods, while regular functions are not bound to any particular class and cannot access its attributes and methods unless they are passed as arguments."],"metadata":{"jp-MarkdownHeadingCollapsed":true,"tags":[],"id":"2hYug4Ml0hNE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##  Principles of Object-oriented programming (OOP)\n","\n","Now that we've create a few class and understand instances lest revisit some of the some some of the basic principles of Object-oriented programming (OOP) that are common across many languages, not just Python:\n","\n","- Encapsulation: This means grouping together data and methods that operate on that data, and hiding the data from the outside world so that it can only be accessed through the methods.\n","- Abstraction: This means defining an interface that provides a simplified view of a more complex system, so that users can interact with it without needing to understand the underlying details.\n","- Inheritance: This allows you to define a new class based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and behaviors.\n","- Polymorphism: This allows you to use a single interface to represent multiple types of objects, so that you can write code that works with different objects in a consistent way.\n","\n","These principles help to organize code into reusable and modular units, making it easier to maintain and update over time.\n","\n","The OOP principles are based on the idea of creating objects that encapsulate data and functionality. These objects can interact with each other through well-defined interfaces, which makes it easier to create complex applications.\n","\n","In the context of a car, we can think of the principles of OOP as the different aspects of a car that make it functional. For example, the principle of encapsulation means that we can separate the various components of the car, such as the engine, transmission, and brakes, into distinct objects that work together to make the car run smoothly.\n","\n","## inheritance\n","\n","Inheritance is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows us to create a new class (called a \"child\" or \"sub\" class) from an existing class (called a \"parent\" or \"super\" class). The child class inherits all of the attributes and behaviors of the parent class, and can also add new attributes and behaviors of its own.\n","\n","For example, let's say we have a Car class that has attributes like make, model, and year, and behaviors like starting the engine and stopping the engine. We can create a new class called ElectricCar that inherits from the Car class, and adds an attribute for battery size and a behavior for charging the battery.\n","\n","To define a child class that inherits from a parent class in Python, we use the syntax class ChildClass(ParentClass):. The child class should have its own __init__ method that calls the parent class's __init__ method using the super() function, so that it inherits the parent class's attributes.\n","\n","Here's an example of how we could define an ElectricCar class that inherits from the Car class:\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"e9Niiu8K0hNF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Parent Class\n","class Car:\n","    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n","        self.make = make\n","        self.model = model\n","        self.year = year\n","\n","    def start_engine(self):\n","        print(\"Engine started.\")\n","\n","    def stop_engine(self):\n","        print(\"Engine stopped.\")\n","\n","# Child Class\n","class ElectricCar(Car):\n","    def __init__(self, make, model, year, battery_size):\n","        super().__init__(make, model, year)\n","        \n","        self.battery_size = battery_size\n","\n","    def charge_battery(self):\n","        print(\"Battery charging.\")\n","        \n","    def start_engine(self):\n","        super().start_engine()\n","        print(\"Radio turned on.\")\n"],"metadata":{"id":"N_n4XP_q0hNF"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In the example above, the ElectricCar class inherits from the Car class using the syntax class ElectricCar(Car):.

It is used when you want to call a method of a superclass in a subclass. The super() function returns a temporary object of the superclass, which allows you to call its methods.\n","\n","By calling super(), you can avoid referring to the base class explicitly, which makes your code more maintainable and flexible. This is because if you change the name of the base class, you only need to update it in one place, in the super() call, rather than everywhere the base class is referenced.\n","\n","For example, let's say you have a Vehicle class that has a method called start_engine().
